# Membean-100Percent-hack

How to use:
1. Copy the 'MEMBEAN SCRIPT'
2. Go to membean and click on start training DO NOT PASTE IN DASHBOARD
3. Do CTRL + SHIFT + I and click at the top right where it says "Console" 
It will look like this: [Screenshot 2023-03-30 1 44 12 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129202086/228920788-5288dde0-4855-4232-8d12-c519102b4b3f.png)
4. Paste the script in BUT DONT HIT ENTER YET
5. After you've changed the time or clicked proceed, click enter on console and it will start.
It gets 100% accuracy every time so if you dont wanna look suspicious get atleast one wrong manually.
I don't recommend turning off skip mode because that makes the accuracy fucked up. 
Have Fun! - Richard Bartholumual IX
